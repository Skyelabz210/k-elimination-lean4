# Frequently Asked Questions

## The Theorem

### What is K-Elimination?

K-Elimination is a closed-form solution for exact division in Residue Number Systems (RNS). Given a value X represented by residues, it recovers the quotient k = floor(X/M) without reconstruction or floating-point approximation.

**The formula:**
```
k = (vₐ - vₘ) · M⁻¹ (mod A)
```

### What problem does this solve?

RNS division has been a bottleneck since Szabó & Tanaka identified it in 1967. Traditional approaches:

| Method | Complexity | Exactness | Parallelism |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Explicit k-tracking | O(1) | Exact | Breaks it |
| Floating-point estimation | O(1) | ~99.9998% | Preserves |
| Mixed Radix Conversion | O(k²) | Exact | Breaks it |
| **K-Elimination** | **O(k)** | **100%** | **Preserves** |

### Why does it work?

The core insight is the **key congruence**:

```
X mod A = (X mod M + k·M) mod A
```

Since X = vₘ + k·M (by definition of division), taking both sides mod A reveals that k·M is encoded in the difference (vₐ - vₘ). Multiplying by M⁻¹ extracts k exactly because k < A.

## Mathematical Deep Dive

### What are the requirements?

1. **Coprimality**: gcd(M, A) = 1 (ensures M⁻¹ exists mod A)
2. **Range bound**: X ∈ [0, M·A) (ensures k < A, so k mod A = k)

### What if gcd(M, A) ≠ 1?

The modular inverse M⁻¹ doesn't exist. You must choose coprime moduli. For RNS, use pairwise coprime bases — a standard requirement anyway.

### What if X ≥ M·A?

The formula gives k mod A, not k. For extended ranges:
- **Anchor stacking**: Chain multiple anchor moduli
- **Tier promotion**: Fall back to arbitrary-precision when bounds exceeded
- **Range partitioning**: Process in M·A-sized chunks

### How is the modular inverse computed?

Extended Euclidean Algorithm gives M⁻¹ in O(log A). For fixed A, precompute M⁻¹ once — then each division is O(1).

### What's the relationship to CRT?

K-Elimination is complementary to CRT. CRT reconstructs X from residues; K-Elimination extracts the quotient directly without full reconstruction. For division by M, K-Elimination is O(k) vs CRT's O(k²).

## Formal Verification

### What does "27 theorems, 0 sorry" mean?

- **27 theorems**: Every mathematical claim is a machine-checked theorem
- **0 sorry**: No axioms, no assumptions, no skipped proofs — complete verification

### What proof assistants were used?

| System | Version | Theorems | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Lean 4 | 4.27.0 | 27 | 0 sorry |
| Coq | 8.20.1 | 11 | 0 admitted |

Cross-validation in two independent proof assistants eliminates tool-specific bugs.

### What is the key_congruence theorem?

```lean
theorem key_congruence (X M A : ℕ) :
    X % A = (X % M + (X / M) * M) % A := by
  have h : X = X % M + (X / M) * M := div_mod_identity X M
  calc X % A = (X % M + (X / M) * M) % A := by rw [← h]
```

This two-line proof is the algebraic foundation. Everything else follows.

### What is k_elimination_sound?

The main soundness theorem:

```lean
theorem k_elimination_sound (X M A : ℕ) (hA : A > 0) (hM : M > 0)
    (h_gcd : Nat.gcd M A = 1) (h_range : X < M * A) :
    (X / M) = ((X % A + A - X % M) * modular_inverse M A) % A
```

This proves the formula is correct under the stated conditions.

### How do I verify it myself?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skyelabz210/k-elimination-lean4.git
cd k-elimination-lean4
lake build                              # Lean 4
coqc coq/K_Elimination.v                # Coq
grep -r "sorry" KElimination.lean       # Should return nothing
```

Expected: builds succeed with no errors, warnings, or unproven goals.

## Implementation & Performance

### What are the benchmark results?

Independent validations on Intel Xeon (2.5-2.6 GHz):

| Operation | Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| K-Elimination Exact Div | 26-29 ns | 35-39M ops/sec |
| Montgomery Multiply | 24-28 ns | 36-41M ops/sec |
| Homomorphic Add | ~3 μs | 340K ops/sec |
| Homo Mul (Plaintext) | ~22 μs | 46K ops/sec |

### Why is K-Elimination so fast?

Three modular operations: two mod (already have vₐ, vₘ), one multiply, one mod. No loops, no iteration, no reconstruction. The formula is algebraically direct.

### What is MANA FHE?

MANA is a proprietary FHE implementation built on K-Elimination. It achieves bootstrap-free rescaling through exact RNS division. The benchmark binary is available for independent validation; source is proprietary.

## FHE Applications

### How does K-Elimination enable bootstrap-free FHE?

FHE schemes (BFV, CKKS) accumulate noise with each operation. "Rescaling" divides ciphertext coefficients to reduce noise. Traditional rescaling:
- Requires bootstrapping (decrypt-under-encryption), or
- Uses floating-point approximation (introduces drift)

K-Elimination provides exact integer division, eliminating both problems.

### What is "zero-drift" arithmetic?

In approximate FHE (CKKS), rescaling errors compound over deep circuits. K-Elimination's 100% exactness means no drift accumulation — the 1000th operation is as precise as the first.

### Can this work with existing FHE libraries?

K-Elimination is a mathematical primitive. It can be integrated into any RNS-based FHE implementation (BFV, BGV, CKKS variants). The algorithm is library-agnostic.

## Advanced Topics

### Can K-Elimination handle signed numbers?

Yes. Use offset encoding: represent signed range [-N, N) as unsigned [0, 2N). Apply K-Elimination, then re-center. The coprimality and range requirements still apply to the encoded values.

### What about non-power-of-two moduli?

K-Elimination works with any coprime M and A. Power-of-two moduli are convenient (bit shifts) but not required. Mersenne primes, NTT-friendly primes, etc. all work.

### Can this extend to multi-level RNS?

Yes. For k-level RNS with moduli M₁, M₂, ..., Mₖ, apply K-Elimination iteratively or use anchor stacking. The key congruence generalizes to each level.

### What's the connection to Montgomery reduction?

Montgomery reduction handles modular multiplication; K-Elimination handles exact division. They're complementary: Montgomery keeps you in residue form for multiplication, K-Elimination lets you divide without leaving residue form.

### Are there attack vectors to consider?

K-Elimination is a deterministic mathematical operation — no timing variability, no secret-dependent branches. The coprimality check should use constant-time comparison if M or A are secret (rare in FHE contexts where parameters are public).

## Development

### Was AI used in development?

Yes. This work was developed by HackFate.us Research in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic). The collaboration involved proof strategy, Lean/Coq debugging, and documentation. The mathematical insight and architectural vision came from the human; rapid iteration and formalization from Claude. Neither could have closed this alone.
